//Nota 1: As opções podem ser ativadas e desativadas usando on/off, yes/no ou 1/0.
//Nota 2: Todas as taxas são em porcentagens, 100 é 100%, 200
//quer dizer 200%, e assim vai.
//Nota 3: O valor não é limitado a 60 mil (veja abaixo)
// Outra informação:
// Todas as opções são limitadas a 60mil (aproximadamente) o qual é 600%

// Defines various mob AI related settings. The mask bits are (add to include multiple settings)
// 1: If disabled, mobs use Aegis-type path searching, that is, they only move on straight
//    lines, and will only change their destination tile after arriving to the previous one.
//    When enabled mobs use more dynamic and complex path searching to chase a player 
//    (they still must be within line of sight to start chasing)
// 2: Makes mob use their "rude attack" skill (usually warping away) if they are attacked and they
//    can't attack back regardless of how they were attacked (eg: GrimTooth), otherwise, their 
//    rude attack" is only activated if they can't melee reach the target (eg: sniping)
// 4: If not set, mobs that can change target only do so when melee attacked (distance player/mob < 3),
//    otherwise mobs may change target and chase ranged attackers.
// 8: If set, when a mob loses track of their target, they stop walking inmediately. Otherwise, they continue
//    to their last target tile. When set mobs also scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode to 
//    make it much harder to mob-train by hiding and collecting them on a single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)
//16: If set, mob skills defined for friends will also trigger on themselves.
